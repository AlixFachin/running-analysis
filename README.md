# Overview

This project started as a test case for getting myself familiar with the (chart.js)[https://www.chartjs.org/] library.

# How does it work
The main file is the `index.html` file which imports all the others.

# Known bugs

- The javascript doens't work for Safari browser.

# Next features

- Incorporation of BABEL library to make the code palatable to all browsers and non-EM6 syntax
- Access to GARMIN or STRAVA API instead of TCX file upload
- More data filtering and data manipulation
